# CodeBank

## Overview

This application provides a **fast and reliable code storage system!** It allows developers and programs to save and
reuse snippets of their code. The user can store their code based on language, and other categories set by the user.
Ideally by using this application the user can **save time.**
A user can store code such as merge sorting algorithm in Java, or template for a webpage design in JavaScript. This will
especially help developers using a language they haven't used in a while to **quickly get up to speed**.

Main Components:

- Storing code snippets.
- Filtering by language and other categories.
- Easy to use interface.

### Why I am building this application

I wanted to build an application that I will find useful. As I write applications, or even simple scripts I often need
to use code similar to or exact as code that I have previously written, but at that moment, I can't recall how to write
it. I spend time relearning algorithms and code that I have used previously, especially if it is in a language haven't
coded in for a while. This application will help solve that issue and increase my efficiency.
